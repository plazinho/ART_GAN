# Art generator (GAN) using PyTorch
- Dataset - ["Best Artworks of All Time"](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time)
- GAN was trained on the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism artworks (about __2400__ images)
- All pictures were resized to __64x64__ and normalized in range __[-1, 1]__
- The training was done for __180__ epochs on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It took approximately __3__ hours
- The number of parameters for the Discriminator and Generator __2,765,568__ and __3,576,704__, respectively
- [Super-resolution](https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution) was applied to some images generated by GAN

- Discriminator architecture:

  ___Images with a shape [3, 64, 64] -> Conv2d -> LeakyReLU activation ->___
  
  ___-> 3 blocks of [Conv2d -> BatchNorm2d -> LeakyReLU activation] ->___
  
  ___-> Conv2d -> Sigmoid activation -> Classification (Real data or created by generator)___
  
- Generator architecture:

  ___Random input with a shape [100, 1, 1] ->___
  
  ___-> 4 blocks of [Conv2d -> BatchNorm2d -> LeakyReLU activation] ->___
  
  ___-> Conv2d -> Tanh activation -> Generated images with a shape [3, 64, 64]___
